    "Los Angeles is located in southern California and is the second most populous city in the United States (second only to New York), as well as the heart of the film and television industries. According to the International Association of Crime Analysts (IACA), crime analysis is defined as a profession and process in which a set of quantitative and qualitative techniques are used to analyze data valuable to police agencies and their communities. It includes the analysis of crime and criminals, crime victims, disorder, quality of life issues, traffic issues, and internal police operations, and its results support criminal investigation and prosecution, patrol activities, crime prevention and reduction strategies, problem solving, and the evaluation of police efforts."

The data set consist of 564162 rows and 28 columns which is collected from 2020 to present. Because the data set contains the most recent crime data, we can clearly analyze the reasons and links between the crimes by taking the victims' age, type of crime, and all the variables in the data set, which helps people to have a clear idea of how to protect or overcome the crimes and also police departments to prevent more crimes from occurring."
