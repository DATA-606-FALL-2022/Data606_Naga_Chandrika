    "\n",
    "## LOS ANGELES CRIME DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name: Naga Chandrika Bhamidi\n",
    "\n",
    "I've come to a topic with conversations regarding crime analysis in cities all around the world. After doing some research to uncover free data, I decided to look into the data in Los Angeles. It is located in southern California and is the second most populous city in the United States (second only to New York), as well as the heart of the film and television industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains the \"Los Angeles crime data history.\" A crime is an unlawful conduct, and we have heard about many sorts of crimes that have occurred in various locations. In this section, I will classify the Los Angeles crime report, which covers all sorts of crimes that are typed on paper, and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. We have data from the year 2020 until the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection includes all legitimate felony, misdemeanor, and infraction offenses reported to the Los Angeles Police Department. The data set consist of 564162 rows and 28 columns which is collected from 2020 to present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables in dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Division of Records Number\n",
    "\n",
    "• Date of crime occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "• Area\n",
    "\n",
    "• Area name\n",
    "\n",
    "• Victim Age\n",

    "\n",
    "• Weapon Used\n",
    "\n",
    "• Longitude Coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques and Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "• Random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "• Support vector machine\n",

    "\n",
    "• K-nearest neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "• Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to build the models using a pipeline and explain how ML models can be used to predict the exact location and weapons used against the victim in a crime. Using EDA, I want to plot the top crime zones, which are the main areas where crimes have occurred, types of crimes, suspects' ages, suspects' gender, and the locations where the crimes are commonly committed on the map.\n",
